# Useful `wp` cli commands and implementations
[wp cli](wp-cli.org) is an _incredibly_ useful tool that has been available to the WordPress community for a while but its only in the last year and a half or so that I've really started using it a lot.

I decided I'm going to start keeping track of all the nice little implementations of wp I've used for various use-cases.

The structure of this repo will likely change over time but I'm going to start with this as the rough structure:

Each folder will be a WordPress resource.  Commands/implementation that is acting on that resource will be in that folder.  Then inside each folder will be a single doc per use-case/implementation.
